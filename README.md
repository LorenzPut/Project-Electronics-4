#Project electronics 4
This repository was created in cooperation with my partner Michiel Mulder for project electronics 4.

## Assignement
This course is the successor of project electronics 4. In the previous car we had to build an RC car. 
In this course the assignement was to improve it, so that the car could be able drive a parcours autonomously
The requirements made for this project consisted out of different levels :

- level 1 : drive an in advance determined route
- level 2 : drive an unknown route
- level 3 : search an object in an open room
- level 4 : search an object in a room with obstacles
- level 5 : do level 4 as fast as possible

The car was given intelligence using an Arduino wich was hooked up to several sensors and a Arduino Leanardo shield containing an H - bridge.
